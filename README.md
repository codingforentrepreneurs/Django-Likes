# Django Likes
Learn how to create a ajax-powered `like` button in Django using `jQuery`.

We show you how to create a `like` button much like what you'd see on Facebook, Instagram, Google+, YouTube, and others. We are using the [Django](http://django.project.com) web framework along with the [Django Rest Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/). The key here in this series is how to setup Django's backend so your project can collect `like` data. We use `jQuery` as a easy-to-implement solution for working with Django but really, this method could be used with any client technology like Angular, React, Swift, Java, and more.
